In order to Run this Python code you must install the library "numpy".
This can be done by using the requirements.txt file.

# The four following Steps will help you run the python program "bonus_assignment.py" from the cmd command line:

1. Open and run command prompt.

2. Navigate to the Source folder, then where the Main Folder is installed usig cd.

3. Type the following command to run the program: 
"python bonus_assignment.py"

4. You will see the program has run and will see the output on the command prompt screen.


# Running this code will display the numerical computational results for 5 various Numerical Calculus topics: 


1. Find the number of iterations it takes for the error to converge to the desired tolerence using Gauss-Seidel method with the following information:

A. Initial Guess: [0,0,0]

B. Tolerence: 1e-6

C. Iterations: 50

D. Using the following matrix:
[3 1 1 1]
[1 4 1 3]
[2 3 7 0]


2. Find the number of iterations it takes for the error to converge to the desired tolerence using the Jacobi method with the following information:

A. Initial Guess: [0,0,0]

B. Tolerence: 1e-6

C. Iterations: 50

D. Using the following matrix:
[3 1 1 1]
[1 4 1 3]
[2 3 7 0]


3. Determine the number of iterations necessary to solve the function f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 2 = 0 using Newton-Raphson aproximation from the left side with the following information:

  |0|    |1|    |1.06|
  |1|    |2|    |1.23|
  |2|    |4|    |1.55|


5. The final value using the modified Eulers method or 2nd order Runge-Kutta with the following information:

A. Function: y – t^3

B. Initial point: 0.5
